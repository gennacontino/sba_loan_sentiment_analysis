Since the FAA issued AD 2017-21-05, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-21-05 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).

AD 2022-21-15 required replacing the rudder T-yoke axle with an improved rudder T-yoke axle. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-21-15, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This AD requires, for certain airplanes, inspecting the rudder steering bracket edge distance and depending on the inspection results, inspecting the T-yoke bolt hole for wear and play, and corrective action if necessary. For certain airplanes this AD requires replacing the rudder T-yoke bolt (axle) with a serviceable part, installing a new self-locking nut, and applying torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head and self-locking nut. For all airplanes this AD requires repetitively inspecting the torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head for proper alignment and the self-locking nut for proper installation and corrective action if necessary. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.',\n",

AD 2017-21-05 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate airworthiness limitations, including new inspection tasks for the drag brace support fitting of the main landing gear (MLG) and to implement corrosion prevention and control program (CPCP) related tasks. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-21-05, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-21-05 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).
